# TAPI 2024: Text Classification with LLMs

This repo contains the notebooks I used to teach a 2024 Text Analysis Pedagogy Institute course on text classification with LLMs.

## Course Description

In this course, you will learn the basics of using a large language model (specifically, ChatGPT) for text classification. Using the ChatGPT application programming interface (API), we will explore how LLMs can assist humanists with various text classification tasks (e.g., binary, labeling, applying confidence intervals to judgments, etc.). We will get to know the API, create validation data, engineer model prompts, and automate API calls for large data sets.

## Content

Each numbered notebook corresponds with one 90-minute class session. The sessions presume that participants are already familiar with Python.
